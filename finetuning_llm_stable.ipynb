            "3. **Influential Passes**: Messi’s passes led to goals (2 x 6-yard crosses), but there were also other influential passes like those from Nicolás Tagliafico (41/37 passes, Degree 1.00) and Ángel Di María (23/30 passes, Degree 1.60).\n",
            "4. **Formulation Changes**: Substituting De Paul (forward) into central attacking positions could increase his influence (PageRank 0.11) and create more chances.\n",
            "5. **Second Half Performance**: Based on the pass network, Argentina likely continued to control possession, but with increased pressure and attempts to exploit weaknesses. Messi might have scored again, but the team would need to maintain possession to capitalize on subsequent attacks.\n",
            "\n",
            "**Suggestions**:\n",
            "- Substitute De Paul into central attacking positions to increase his influence and create more chances.\n",
            "- Maintain possession to take advantage of Messi’s ability to find space and create chances.\n",

            "3. **Formations and Player Utilization**: With **Enzo Fernández** (Position 6) having high pass completion rates, his role might benefit from being involved in more central attacks, alongside **Lionel Messi**, to increase chances of creating scoring opportunities.\n",
